        TypeScript is not just an academic or experimental language; it is
        widely used in various real-world applications. Here are some examples
        of where TypeScript excels:
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.1 Web Development</h2>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          Angular: TypeScript is the primary language for Angular, a popular
          front-end framework. Its strong typing and tooling make it an ideal
          choice for building complex web applications.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          React: While React primarily uses JavaScript, many developers use
          TypeScript to add type checking and better tooling to their React
          projects. The TypeScript team also maintains a library called
          @types/react to provide TypeScript support for React.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Vue.js: Vue.js, another popular front-end framework, offers TypeScript
          support and encourages its usage for enhanced development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.2 Server-Side Development</h2>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          Node.js: TypeScript can be used for server-side development with
          Node.js. The ability to add types and benefit from strong tooling is
          advantageous in building server applications.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Deno: Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, is
          designed to work seamlessly with TypeScript. It allows developers to
          write server-side applications using TypeScript.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.3 Full-Stack Development</h2>
      <p>
        Many developers use TypeScript for both the front-end and back-end,
        enabling full-stack development with a single language and shared code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.4 Desktop Applications</h2>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          Electron: TypeScript is often used in Electron, a framework for
          building cross-platform desktop applications. Its strong typing and
          code safety are valuable in this context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.5 Mobile Development</h2>
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: "20px" }}>
        <li>
          React Native: TypeScript can be integrated into React Native for
          mobile app development. It offers enhanced type safety for mobile
          apps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.6 Game Development</h2>
      <p>
        Some game engines and frameworks, such as Phaser, provide TypeScript
        support for building games.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.7 Cloud and Backend Services</h2>
      <p>
        Developers often use TypeScript to build serverless functions,
        microservices, and backend services on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure,
        and Google Cloud.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.8 DevOps and Tools</h2>
      <p>
        TypeScript can be used to build developer tools, command-line utilities,
        and automation scripts for DevOps processes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.9 Financial and Enterprise Applications</h2>
      <p>
        TypeScript is well-suited for building large-scale financial and
        enterprise applications where type safety, maintainability, and
        scalability are crucial.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 style={{color:"lightBlue"}}>11.10 Education and Learning Platforms</h2>
      <p>
        Some e-learning and educational platforms use TypeScript to build
        interactive lessons and coding environments.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These real-world applications demonstrate the versatility and power of
        TypeScript across various domains. Its type checking, tooling, and
        ability to integrate with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks
        make it a valuable choice for modern software development.
